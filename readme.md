This is a collection of classwork for CS131A at [City College of San Francisco](http://www.ccsf.edu/). The class is running from 2018-08-20 to 2018-12-20. As of this writing, I have yet to finish the class. _NOTE: Some of these may have been modified since they were originally turned in._

Here is a list of the assignments as originally given in the class syllabus. The list is modified, removing the reading assignments and leaving only the program instructions.

1. **Server** - Write a program that does nothing because it contains only exuberant comments. Due 8/26.

2. **Interpreter** - Write a program that prints out the complete name and address of a restaurant you dislike. Due 9/2.

3. **Types** - Every state in the U.S. has two senators no matter its population. Write a program that shows how much more powerful Idahoans are than Floridians in the Senate. Make sure to cite the sources of the numbers you use. Due 9/9.

4. **Math** - Write a program to determine what fraction of global population has permanent representation on the United Nations Security Council. Make sure to cite the sources of the numbers you use. Due 9/16.

5. **Containers I** - Write a program that prints out its own command line arguments in reverse order from last to first. Due 9/23.

6. **Containers II** - Write a program that prints out the command line arguments it receives, in alphabetical order and without duplicates. Due 9/30.

7. **Flow** - Extend last week's program so that it also reports the number of times each argument occurred. Due 10/7.

8. **Functions** - Write a program that reports the number, mean, median, mode, and midpoint of numeric command line arguments, using functions that determine these statistics. Due 10/14.

9. **Exceptions** - Extend the last program so that non-numeric arguments are regarded as integers with value equivalent to their length in characters. Due 10/21.

10. **Object Orientation** - Define a class, objects of which can make the same function calls as the last program. It should have a useful string representation and the command line invocation should still work. Due 10/28.

11. **Files** - Write a program that displays a word six letters long randomly chosen from the dictionary /users/abrick/resources/english. Due 11/4. _NOTE: "Dictionary file" not provided, but any text file will do to test the program's functionality.

_Note: The following assignments have not yet been assigned:_

12. **Regular expressions I**

13. **Regular Expressions II**

14. **Web client**

15. **Web service I**

16. **Web Service II**
